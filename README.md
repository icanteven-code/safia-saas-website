# Safia SaaS website

This is a learning project using the [Safia SaaS Template 🟣 by Flowbase.co](https://www.figma.com/community/file/892582971189995704). This project is created exclusively for learning and the target is to show the workflow of creating a some-what real page via HTML, CSS & JS. No fancy (and unnecessary framewroks will be used). I want to play around with couple of new (for me) things like Parcel, Open Props CSS, etc. These will be marked as "features" and we'll be learnign and working with them in the process of building the whole website.

## Features
- 📦 Parcel - fast bunlder and developing experience, also with additional benefits like:
  - Superchagin our CSS experience via things like clamp ( [Syntax lowering](https://parceljs.org/languages/css/#syntax-lowering) ) and mainly CSS nesting ( [CSS Nesting](https://parceljs.org/languages/css/#nesting) )
  - Checking out (and using) their ⚡ Lightning CSS bundler ( [Lightning CSS with Parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/lightningcss#with-parcel) )
  - Image optimisation via the [Parcel Image](https://parceljs.org/recipes/image/) module
 - 🎨 Design tokens via [Open Props](https://open-props.style/)
 - 🖌️ Design system - extending Open Props and based on the [Cube CSS](https://cube.fyi/) methodology
    - Light/Dark theming
    - Media queries based on hover effects, etc.
 - 🏋️ Lazy loading (iamges, possibly text)
 - 👀 Animations on scroll (possibly custom functions with Intersection Observer API)

## Live coding sessions (Bulgarian language 🇧🇬)
- TBD
